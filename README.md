# Computer Architecture Course

Projects made in MIPS, x86 and x86-64 Assemblies for computer architecture course.

## Overview

The task was to make few simple and two big projects in each assembly (on each architecture).

### MIPS Assemply

#### Description

Mips assembly is a language made for RISC architecture devices. The big project consisted of converting non-ascii characters into their escape sequences. More details in MIPS folder.

#### Usage

To run projects written in MIPS, a simulator is needed - I have written and tested my projects using MARS simulator.

### x86 Assembly

#### Description

In x86 I was writing projects for devices built in CISC architecture. The big project is a hybrid of C and x86 - x86-64 assembly (for maximising its performance). Its task was to flip diagonaly 2 bit BMP file, so that each (x, y) pixel becomes (y, x) pixel. I made this project in 32 bit and 64 bit version.

#### Usage

To run projects written in x86, the proper compiler is needed - I have used NASM.
