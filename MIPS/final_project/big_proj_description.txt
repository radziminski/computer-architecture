MIPS project â€“ exercise 3
Write a program in MIPS assembly using MARS or other SPIM-compatible simulator. The program should
not rely on uninitialized register values and should be able to be run more than once without reloading.
Avoid the sequences of consecutive branches, esp. conditional branches followed by unconditional ones
(unless necessary).
All the text processing programs with file i/o should define getc and putc functions for single-character i/o,
providing proper buffering of input and input operations with at least 512-byte buffers.
Graphic programs should display images using MARS graphic display mapped to heap address range.
Maximum score is 6 points. The project may be shown during two lab sessions. Each week of delay started
will introduce a penalty of one point.
Projects are assigned according to the position on the ECOAR students list, shown above.

Write a program replacing all non-ASCII characters in a valid C source file with C-language
hexadecimal escape sequences. The program should be capable of producing valid C source from a
C program containing non-ASCII characters embedded in strings and character constants.
